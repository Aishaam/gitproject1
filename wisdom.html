<p> Wisdom has no stories, no colors, no form.
It is simply this and always be this, never changing, never reaching, never grabbing, but present everywhere in everything, in every action, in every moment, it doesnâ€™t increase or decrease or can be grown in your mental garden.
Wisdom is like an invisible flower, you sense the fragrance at the best.</p>
